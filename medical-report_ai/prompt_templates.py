    **Original Patient Data:**

    Generate the final report using Markdown formatting. The report must have these sections:
    - **Patient Details**: (from original data)
    - **Imaging Study**: (from original data)
    - **Summary of Findings**: (Translate the summary from the analysis into simple, clear terms)
    - **Detailed Explanation**: (Explain the key features, location, and mass effect in an understandable way)
    - **Possible Interpretations**: (List the differential diagnosis provided, explaining that these are possibilities that need further testing)
    - **Recommended Next Steps**: (Clearly state the recommendations in an actionable way)
